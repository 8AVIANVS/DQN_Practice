# 2 Player DQN Game

A two-player game implementation using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for reinforcement learning.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main game entry point
- `agents/`: Directory containing DQN agent implementations
- `environment/`: Game environment implementation
- `models/`: Neural network model definitions

## Usage

Run the game:
```bash
python main.py
```
